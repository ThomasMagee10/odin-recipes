This recipe courtesy of Gordon Ramsey is aweosome. Very filling dish that hits all the savory notes I'm looking for.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil, for frying</li>
    <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped (but not too small)</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, very finely sliced</li>
    <li>5 spiced sausages, e.g. Italian chilli</li>
    <li>1 heaped teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
    <li>200g long-grain rice (1 cup)</li>
    <li>½ glass dry white wine</li>
    <li>500ml (2 cups) chicken stock</li>
    <li>4 spring onions, trimmed and sliced </li>
    <li>2 tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preperation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Add just 1 tbsp of Olive oil to a heavy-based casserole dish and fry the onion for 5 minutes until soft but not coloured.</li>
    <li>Add the pepper and garlic and cook for 2 minutes while moving it about so the garlic doesn't burn.</li>
    <li>Slit the sausage skins and crumble the sausage meat so it looks like small meatballs.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat to high (otherwise, the sausage will steam rather than brown). Cook while moving it about a bit in the pan for about 4-5 minutes until coloured.</li>
    <li>Add the smoked paprika and mix and season to taste.</li>
    <li>Add the rice and stir well to mix thoroughly and absorb the flavour.</li>
    <li>Now deglaze the pan by pouring in the white wine and scraping any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
    <li>Add the stock and bring to a boil and then turn to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Cook gently for 15–20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid almost entirely absorbed. Keep an eye on it and stir from time to time.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat, gently fold in the spring onions, tomato and parsley and serve.</li>
</ol>
